# Lab Description
The purpose of this lab is to learn how to create a serverless ML Pipeline

## Assignment 1 

### Task 1 
This task conisted of running the Teacher's code and understanding the basics of the services used. We used:  
- MODAL (CRON job)
- HOPSWORKS (FeatureStore, Deployed Model, etc)
- HUGGINGFACE SPACES(UI)

The deploy links are the following:
1) [Inference](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Potatoasdasdasdasda/Cheesy-Nachos)
2) [Monitor](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Potatoasdasdasdasda/Cheesy-Nachos-Monitoring) 


### Task 2 
This task consisted of using a new dataset and modifying the Task 1 code.    

The additional tasks performed were:    
1) Preprocessing the dataset  
2) Exploratory Data Analysis  
3) Determining a suitable ML Model using GridSearch   
4) Creating a synthetic generator by using [CGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784)  
5) Updating Task 1 code so that it can be used for the new dataset  

The file structure is the same as Task 1.
